  <meta name="description" content=" In scenarios where a seller holds sensitive data *x*, like employee / patient records or ecological data, and a buyer seeks to obtain an evaluation of specific function *f* on this data, solutions in trustless digital environments like blockchain-based Web3 systems typically fall into two categories: (1) Smart contract-powered solutions and (2) cryptographic solutions leveraging tools such as adaptor signatures. The former approach offers atomic transactions where the buyer learns the function evaluation *f(x)* (and not *x* entirely) upon payment. However, this approach is often inefficient, costly, lacks privacy for the seller&#39;s data, and is incompatible with systems that do not support smart contracts with required functionalities. In contrast, the adaptor signature-based approach addresses all of the above issues but comes with an ``all-or-nothing&#39;&#39; guarantee, where the buyer fully extracts *x* and does not support functional extraction of the sensitive data. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between these approaches, developing a solution that enables fair functional sales of information while offering improved efficiency, privacy, and compatibility similar to adaptor signatures.

Towards this, we propose *functional adaptor signatures (FAS)* a novel cryptographic primitive that achieves all the desired properties as listed above. Using FAS, the seller can publish an advertisement committing to *x*. The buyer can pre-sign the payment transaction w.r.t. a function *f*, and send it along with the transaction to the seller. The seller adapts the pre-signature into a valid (buyer&#39;s) signature and posts the payment and the adapted signature on the blockchain to get paid. Finally, using the pre-signature and the posted signature, the buyer efficiently extracts *f(x)*, and completes the sale. We formalize the security properties of FAS, among which is a new notion called *witness privacy* to capture seller&#39;s privacy, which ensures the buyer does not learn anything beyond *f(x)*. We present multiple variants of witness privacy, namely, *witness hiding, witness indistinguishability*, and *zero-knowledge*, to capture varying levels of leakage about *x* beyond *f(x)* to a malicious buyer.

We introduce two efficient constructions of FAS supporting linear functions (like statistics/aggregates, kernels in machine learning, etc.), that satisfy the strongest notion of witness privacy. One construction is based on prime-order groups and compatible with Schnorr signatures for payments, and the other is based on lattices and compatible with a variant of Lyubashevsky&#39;s signature scheme. A central conceptual contribution of our work lies in revealing a surprising connection between functional encryption, a well-explored concept over the past decade, and adaptor signatures, a relatively new primitive in the cryptographic landscape. On a technical level, we avoid heavy cryptographic machinery and achieve improved efficiency, by making black-box use of building blocks like *inner product functional encryption (IPFE)* while relying on certain security-enhancing techniques for the IPFE in a non-black-box manner. We implement our FAS construction for Schnorr signatures and show that for reasonably sized seller witnesses, the different operations are quite efficient even for commodity hardware. " />

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract"><p>In scenarios where a seller holds sensitive data <em>x</em>, like employee / patient records or ecological data, and a buyer seeks to obtain an evaluation of specific function <em>f</em> on this data, solutions in trustless digital environments like blockchain-based Web3 systems typically fall into two categories: (1) Smart contract-powered solutions and (2) cryptographic solutions leveraging tools such as adaptor signatures. The former approach offers atomic transactions where the buyer learns the function evaluation <em>f(x)</em> (and not <em>x</em> entirely) upon payment. However, this approach is often inefficient, costly, lacks privacy for the seller&rsquo;s data, and is incompatible with systems that do not support smart contracts with required functionalities. In contrast, the adaptor signature-based approach addresses all of the above issues but comes with an ``all-or-nothing&rsquo;&rsquo; guarantee, where the buyer fully extracts <em>x</em> and does not support functional extraction of the sensitive data. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between these approaches, developing a solution that enables fair functional sales of information while offering improved efficiency, privacy, and compatibility similar to adaptor signatures.</p>
<p>Towards this, we propose <em>functional adaptor signatures (FAS)</em> a novel cryptographic primitive that achieves all the desired properties as listed above. Using FAS, the seller can publish an advertisement committing to <em>x</em>. The buyer can pre-sign the payment transaction w.r.t. a function <em>f</em>, and send it along with the transaction to the seller. The seller adapts the pre-signature into a valid (buyer&rsquo;s) signature and posts the payment and the adapted signature on the blockchain to get paid. Finally, using the pre-signature and the posted signature, the buyer efficiently extracts <em>f(x)</em>, and completes the sale. We formalize the security properties of FAS, among which is a new notion called <em>witness privacy</em> to capture seller&rsquo;s privacy, which ensures the buyer does not learn anything beyond <em>f(x)</em>. We present multiple variants of witness privacy, namely, <em>witness hiding, witness indistinguishability</em>, and <em>zero-knowledge</em>, to capture varying levels of leakage about <em>x</em> beyond <em>f(x)</em> to a malicious buyer.</p>
<p>We introduce two efficient constructions of FAS supporting linear functions (like statistics/aggregates, kernels in machine learning, etc.), that satisfy the strongest notion of witness privacy. One construction is based on prime-order groups and compatible with Schnorr signatures for payments, and the other is based on lattices and compatible with a variant of Lyubashevsky&rsquo;s signature scheme. A central conceptual contribution of our work lies in revealing a surprising connection between functional encryption, a well-explored concept over the past decade, and adaptor signatures, a relatively new primitive in the cryptographic landscape. On a technical level, we avoid heavy cryptographic machinery and achieve improved efficiency, by making black-box use of building blocks like <em>inner product functional encryption (IPFE)</em> while relying on certain security-enhancing techniques for the IPFE in a non-black-box manner. We implement our FAS construction for Schnorr signatures and show that for reasonably sized seller witnesses, the different operations are quite efficient even for commodity hardware.</p>
