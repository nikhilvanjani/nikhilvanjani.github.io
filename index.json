My ambition is to develop cryptographic tools to build technology that can be trusted. On one hand, I enjoy studying problems such as fully homomorphic encryption and functional encryption which have engendered a new wave of exuberance in the research community in recent years. On the other, it is also motivating to see cryptography applied to solve practical problems, such as the impact of zero-knowledge arguments on making blockchains scalable and more secure. My current work focuses on functional encryption and program obfuscation.\nYou can find my CV here.\nPlease feel free to contact me at nvanjani [at] cmu.edu.\nNEWS\nResearch Internship at NTT Research during Summer\u0026#39;24 Our work on Functional Adaptor Signatures got accepted to CCS\u0026#39;24 ","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to have Elaine Shi as my advsior.

Until the very recent work of Shi and Wu (Eurocrypt’21), all classical anonymous routing schemes are *interactive* protocols, and their security rely on a *threshold* number of the routers being honest. The recent work of Shi and Wu suggested a new abstraction called Non-Interactive Anonymous Router (NIAR), and showed how to achieve anonymous routing *non-interactively* for the first time. In particular, a *single untrusted router* receives a token which allows it to obliviously apply a permutation to a set of encrypted messages from the senders. Shi and Wu’s construction suffers from two drawbacks: 1) the router takes time *quadratic* in the number of senders to obliviously route their messages; and 2) the scheme is proven secure only in the presence of static corruptions.\nIn this work, we show how to construct a non-interactive anonymous router scheme with *sub-quadratic* router computation, and achieving security in the presence of *adaptive corruptions*. To get this result, we assume the existence of indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way functions. Our final result is obtained through a sequence of stepping stones. First, we show how to achieve the desired efficiency, but with security under static corruption and in a selective, single-challenge setting. Then, we go through a sequence of upgrades which eventually get us the final result. We devise various new techniques along the way which lead to some additional results. In particular, our techniques for reasoning about a *network of obfuscated programs* may be of independent interest.\n","tags":[],"title":"Non-Interactive Anonymous Router with Quasi-Linear Router Computation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elaine Shi","Nikhil Vanjani (randomized author order)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1674604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674604800,"objectID":"ac06365b37994d64d201b0edcffa302a","permalink":"https://nikhilvanjani.github.io/publication/mcipe/","publishdate":"2022-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mcipe/","section":"publication","summary":"In a Multi-Client Functional Encryption (MCFE) scheme,  *n* clients each obtain a secret encryption key from  a trusted authority. During each time step *t*, each client *i* can encrypt its data using its secret key. The authority can use its master secret key to compute  a functional key given a function *f*, and the functional key can be applied to a collection of *n* clients' ciphertexts encrypted to the same time step, resulting in the outcome of *f* on the clients' data. In this paper, we focus on MCFE for *inner-product* computations.\n\nIf an MCFE scheme hides not only the clients' data, but also the function *f*,  we say it is *function hiding*. Although MCFE for inner-product computation has been extensively studied,  how to achieve function privacy is still poorly understood. The very recent work of Agrawal et al. showed how to construct a *function-hiding* MCFE scheme for inner-product  assuming standard bilinear group assumptions; however, they assume the existence of a random oracle and prove only a relaxed, selective security notion. An intriguing open question is whether we can achieve function-hiding MCFE for inner-product *without* random oracles.\n\nIn this work, we are the first to show a function-hiding MCFE scheme for inner products, relying on standard bilinear group assumptions. Further, we prove *adaptive* security without the use of a random oracle. Our scheme also achieves succinct ciphertexts, that is,  each coordinate in the plaintext vector encrypts to only *O(1)* group elements.\n\nOur main technical contribution is a new upgrade from single-input functional encryption for inner-products to a multi-client one. Our upgrade preserves function privacy, that is, if the original single-input scheme is function-hiding, so is the resulting multi-client construction. Further, this new upgrade allows us to obtain a conceptually simple construction.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Client Inner Product Encryption: Function-Hiding Instantiations Without Random Oracles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikhil Vanjani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1668502800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668502800,"objectID":"5a09ab6e17b9ddbb24028f74ed6b7cbe","permalink":"https://nikhilvanjani.github.io/talk/non-interactive-anonymous-router-with-quasi-linear-router-computation/","publishdate":"2022-11-15T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/non-interactive-anonymous-router-with-quasi-linear-router-computation/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Non-Interactive Anonymous Router with Quasi-Linear Router Computation","type":"event"},{"authors":["Nikhil Vanjani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639094400,"objectID":"d83cc45ad74349a756241c061f060211","permalink":"https://nikhilvanjani.github.io/publication/masters_thesis/","publishdate":"2021-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/masters_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"In a Multi-Input Functional Encryption (MIFE) scheme, n clients each obtain a secret encryption key from a trusted authority. Each client i can encrypt its data using its secret key. The authority can use its master secret key to compute a functional key given a function f, and the functional key can be applied to a collection of n clients’ ciphertexts, resulting in the outcome of f on the clients’ data. If an MIFE scheme hides not only the clients’ data but also the function f, we say it is function hiding. In this work, we study function-hiding security of two variants of MIFE for inner-product computations.\n\nMulti-Client Functional Encryption (MCFE) is a strengthening of MIFE where clients associate their encrypted data with some time step t and the outcome of f can be computed only on ciphertexts encrypted to the same time step. Although MCFE for inner-product computation has been extensively studied, most earlier works on MCFE do not achieve func- tion privacy. The recent work by Agrawal et al. showed how to construct a function-hiding MCFE for inner-product from standard assumptions and the existence of a random oracle. An intriguing open question is whether we can achieve the same without random oracles. In this work, we are the first to show such a function-hiding MCFE for inner products, relying on the standard Decisional Linear assumption. Our main technical contribution is a new up- grade from single-input functional encryption for inner-products to a multi-client one; and, if the single-input scheme is function-hiding, so is the resulting multi-client scheme.\n\nAd Hoc MIFE (AMIFE) is a decentralized version of MIFE. In AMIFE, the users can jointly decide in a decentralized way what function they would allow to be evaluated on their joint data. The aforementioned work by Agrawal et al. also showed how to construct a function-hiding AMIFE scheme for inner-products, relying on standard bilinear group assumptions, and without random oracles. We construct a new AMIFE scheme that provides the same security guarantees as this earlier work but our construction provides a nicer abstraction making the scheme and the security proofs conceptually simpler.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Input Inner Product Encryption: Function-Hiding Instantiations without Random Oracles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikhil Vanjani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637586000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637586000,"objectID":"639358600d38262821281216dbb4060f","permalink":"https://nikhilvanjani.github.io/talk/multi-input-inner-product-encryption-function-hiding-instantiations-without-random-oracles/","publishdate":"2021-11-22T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/multi-input-inner-product-encryption-function-hiding-instantiations-without-random-oracles/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Input Inner Product Encryption: Function-Hiding Instantiations without Random Oracles","type":"event"},{"authors":["Nikhil Vanjani","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
