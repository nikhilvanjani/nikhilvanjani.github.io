In this setup, the seller holds sensitive data *x* (e.g., patient records, climate data), and the buyer specifies a function *f* (e.g., aggregate, sum). FAS guarantees that the buyer learns *f (x)* (and nothing beyond) if and only if the seller receives payment in blockchain-based tokens. Unlike generic smart contracts, FAS-powered solutions excel in privacy, efficiency, and compatibility with diverse blockchain systems. However, prior FAS constructions were limited to linear functions (where *f* was linear in *x*), restricting their applicability to more complex and prevalent applications including data analytics and ML model evaluations.\n\nIn this work, we extend the capabilities of FAS to support higher-degree functions (*deg ≥ 2*), significantly broadening its range of applications. Our core contribution is a novel FAS design leveraging homomorphic encryption, which simultaneously achieves enhanced efficiency and compatibility for general functions. This approach diverges fundamentally from the restricted design in CCS’24 which relied on connections to functional encryption. We implement our homomorphic encryption-based FAS for functions arising in applications such as data analytics and machine learning inference. Remarkably, even for linear functions, our new design achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in performance compared to CCS’24 constructions. Furthermore, our solutions seamlessly integrate with prominent blockchain systems, requiring only a basic signature verification script on standard transactions, thus ensuring practical deployability. As a conceptual contribution, we introduce the general paradigm of a blockchain-based functional fair exchange (FFE) protocol, rigorously define buyer and seller fairness, and show that FAS implies the general goal of FFE.

Previous constructions either tolerated only static authority corruption or relied on highly complex “dual system with dual-subsystems” proof technique that inflated ciphertexts and keys.\n\nOur first contribution is a streamlined security analysis showing – perhaps surprisingly – that the classic Lewko–Waters MA-ABE scheme [EUROCRYPT 2011] already achieves full adaptive security, provided its design is carefully reinterpreted and, more crucially, its security proof is re-orchestrated to conclude with an information-theoretic hybrid in place of the original target- group-based computational step. By dispensing with dual subsystems and target-group-based assumptions, we achieve a significantly simpler and tighter security proof along with a more lightweight implementation. Our construction reduces ciphertext size by 33 percent, shrinks user secret keys by 66 percent, and requires 50 percent fewer pairing operations during decryption – all while continuing to support arbitrary collusions of users and authorities. These improvements mark a notable advance over the state-of-the-art fully adaptive decentralized MA-ABE scheme of Datta et al. [EUROCRYPT 2023]. We instantiate the scheme in both composite-order bilinear groups under standard subgroup-decision assumptions and in asymmetric prime-order bilinear groups under the Matrix-Diffie–Hellman assumption. We further show how the Kowalczyk–Wee attribute-reuse technique [EUROCRYPT 2019] seamlessly lifts our construction from “one-use” boolean span programs (BSP) to “multi-use” policies computable in NC1, resulting in a similarly optimized construction over the state-of-the-art by Chen et al. [ASIACRYPT 2023].\n\nGoing beyond the Boolean world, we present the first MA-ABE construction for arithmetic span program (ASP) access policies, capturing a richer class of Boolean, arithmetic, and combinatorial computations. This advancement also enables improved concrete efficiency by allowing attributes to be handled directly as field elements, thereby eliminating the overhead of converting arithmetic computations into Boolean representations. The construction – again presented in composite and prime orders – retains decentralization and adaptive user-key security, and highlights inherent barriers to handling corrupted authorities in the arithmetic setting.

The former approach offers atomic transactions where the buyer learns the function evaluation *f(x)* (and not *x* entirely) upon payment. However, this approach is often inefficient, costly, lacks privacy for the seller's data, and is incompatible with systems that do not support smart contracts with required functionalities. In contrast, the adaptor signature-based approach addresses all of the above issues but comes with an ``all-or-nothing'' guarantee, where the buyer fully extracts *x* and does not support functional extraction of the sensitive data. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between these approaches, developing a solution that enables fair functional sales of information while offering improved efficiency, privacy, and compatibility similar to adaptor signatures.\n\nTowards this, we propose *functional adaptor signatures (FAS)* a novel cryptographic primitive that achieves all the desired properties as listed above. Using FAS, the seller can publish an advertisement committing to *x*. The buyer can pre-sign the payment transaction w.r.t. a function *f*, and send it along with the transaction to the seller. The seller adapts the pre-signature into a valid (buyer's) signature and posts the payment and the adapted signature on the blockchain to get paid. Finally, using the pre-signature and the posted signature, the buyer efficiently extracts *f(x)*, and completes the sale. We formalize the security properties of FAS, among which is a new notion called *witness privacy* to capture seller's privacy, which ensures the buyer does not learn anything beyond *f(x)*. We present multiple variants of witness privacy, namely, *witness hiding, witness indistinguishability*, and *zero-knowledge*, to capture varying levels of leakage about *x* beyond *f(x)* to a malicious buyer.\n\nWe introduce two efficient constructions of FAS supporting linear functions (like statistics/aggregates, kernels in machine learning, etc.), that satisfy the strongest notion of witness privacy. One construction is based on prime-order groups and compatible with Schnorr signatures for payments, and the other is based on lattices and compatible with a variant of Lyubashevsky's signature scheme. A central conceptual contribution of our work lies in revealing a surprising connection between functional encryption, a well-explored concept over the past decade, and adaptor signatures, a relatively new primitive in the cryptographic landscape. On a technical level, we avoid heavy cryptographic machinery and achieve improved efficiency, by making black-box use of building blocks like *inner product functional encryption (IPFE)* while relying on certain security-enhancing techniques for the IPFE in a non-black-box manner. We implement our FAS construction for Schnorr signatures and show that for reasonably sized seller witnesses, the different operations are quite efficient even for commodity hardware.

Until the very recent work of Shi and Wu (Eurocrypt’21), all classical anonymous routing schemes are *interactive* protocols, and their security rely on a *threshold* number of the routers being honest. The recent work of Shi and Wu suggested a new abstraction called Non-Interactive Anonymous Router (NIAR), and showed how to achieve anonymous routing *non-interactively* for the first time. In particular, a *single untrusted router* receives a token which allows it to obliviously apply a permutation to a set of encrypted messages from the senders. Shi and Wu’s construction suffers from two drawbacks: 1) the router takes time *quadratic* in the number of senders to obliviously route their messages; and 2) the scheme is proven secure only in the presence of static corruptions.\nIn this work, we show how to construct a non-interactive anonymous router scheme with *sub-quadratic* router computation, and achieving security in the presence of *adaptive corruptions*. To get this result, we assume the existence of indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way functions. Our final result is obtained through a sequence of stepping stones. First, we show how to achieve the desired efficiency, but with security under static corruption and in a selective, single-challenge setting. Then, we go through a sequence of upgrades which eventually get us the final result. We devise various new techniques along the way which lead to some additional results. In particular, our techniques for reasoning about a *network of obfuscated programs* may be of independent interest.\n","tags":[],"title":"Non-Interactive Anonymous Router with Quasi-Linear Router Computation","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Elaine Shi","Nikhil Vanjani (randomized author order)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1674604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674604800,"objectID":"2be458f6cc7fc981be9f94114f8a0f44","permalink":"https://nikhilvanjani.github.io/publications/mcipe/","publishdate":"2022-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/mcipe/","section":"publications","summary":"In a Multi-Client Functional Encryption (MCFE) scheme,  *n* clients each obtain a secret encryption key from  a trusted authority.
